## Priority

In programming, prioritize the following.

1. *Correctness*, the program must run according to the purpose & function
   his business. It's useless to use the latest technology, popular libraries but
   the program does not run as expected by functions & requirements. Though
   Thus, bugs logic & errors in the program will definitely be found.
2. *Readability*, program is easy for other team members to read. By
   Therefore, it needs the same standard in terms of naming route paths, variables,
   files, their folder structure & organization. Including logging, because it is related
   readability in the debugging process.
4. *Performance*, if the program is running correctly & the source code
   neat, then we think about performance optimization. By using
   GoLang, 90% of us have been helped in terms of performance & resource utilization
   server.

## Technology

Here are the technologies we will be using in the backend development
services WIT.ID.

* HTTP JSON API from mobile app using `echo.Echo`
* NoSQL using Apache CASSANDRA
* Cache using redis
* RDBMS using PostgreSQL, MariaDB

> Have an idea for another storage / framework implementation? Please communicate in advance with their respective superiors.
